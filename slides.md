## Motivation

---

### Early stages of planetary evolution

- Observations of circumstellar disks
- Good understanding of physical processes

---

### Late stages of planetary evolution

- Mature planetary systems
- Catalogue of detected extrasolar planets
- Puts solar system into perspective

---

### Phase in between?

- Planetary population synthesis
- Study of embedded planets

---

### Observing embedded planets with new generation

- SPHERE/VLT
- METIS/E-ELT
- MIRI/JWST
- ALMA

---

### Constrain physical properties of embedded planet

- mass
- effective temperature
- luminosity
- spectrum

---

## Project outlook

---

### Dynamical models of disk features caused by planets

- Accretion onto the planet
- Circumplanetary disk
- Flow pattern

---

### Radiation Hydrodynamics

- Flux-limited diffusion (or M1?)
- Frequency-dependent irradiation
- Opacities
- PLUTO for hydrodynamics
- Implementations by Kuiper/Flock?

---

### Adaptive mesh refinement

---

## Conclusion

Interesting observations to interpret anyone?
