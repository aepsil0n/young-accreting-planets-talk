Happy to present my research

More of an outlook, no results yet

Open to suggestions by all the experts

Note:

Current and next-gen observatories will give us more data

- SPHERE/VLT
- METIS/E-ELT
- MIRI/JWST
- ALMA

Visible, IR, Millimeter

Direct detection of accreting planets?

### Schematic overview

Note:

- make a drawing here that shows the basic features
- talk about individual features
- make clear what the focus of this work is
- use this as a guideline to come back to?


### Numerical models

Note:

disk thickens around planet, high pressure scale height
donut-shaped structure


### Synthetic observations

Source: Ruge, Wolf, Uribe, Klahr (2014)

Note:

Should show features like

- Accretion onto the planet
- Circumplanetary disk
- Horseshoe orbits
- Ring structures
- Spiral waves

Feasibility of detecting gaps (caused by planets) with ALMA


### Interpreting observations

- *Dynamical model of planet-disk system*
- Detailed model of observed radiation (S. Wolf, Uni Kiel)
  - Radiative transfer models
  - Instrument effects

---

### Dynamical models of planet-disk system

- Internal energy of disk is dominated by radiation
- 3D radiation hydrodynamical numerical models

Note:

Treat radiation as accurately as possible in a dynamical setup


### Hydrodynamics

PLUTO for hydrodynamics (Mignone et al. 2007)

Note:

experience in group
availability of accurate radiation models


### Radiative transfer

<img src="images/radtrans-schematic-plain.svg" width="600" />

Note:

Approximate radiation model used within fluid simulations


<img src="images/radtrans-schematic-diffusion.svg" width="600" />

- Flux-limited diffusion (Kuiper et al., 2010)
- Improve to M1 closure later

Note:

FLD is a strong simplification of radiative transfer

fast, thus practical for dynamical simulations
but leads to inaccuracies for transition from optically thin to optically thick
parts of the disk

gray approximation

Frequency-dependent ray-tracing (Kuiper et al., 2010 & 2013)

Note:

stellar irradiation using frequency-dependent ray-tracing

refer to Flock et al. (2013) as alternative implementation

Kuiper & Klessen (2013)

Note:

Flux-limited diffusion not sufficient on its own

caveat not even this is accurate for intermediate optical depths around 10^3

### Current state

- 2D axis-symmetric radiation hydro setup
- Next steps: move to 3D, introduce the planet
- Collaboration on modelling real systems


### Further aspects to take into account

- Dust opacities
- Gas opacities (Malygin, Kuiper, Klahr, Dullemond, Henning; 2014)
- Accretion shock at planet (Marleau, Klahr, Kuiper, Mordasini; 2017)
- Adaptive mesh refinement
- Ionization for hot regions

Note:

AMR is very useful for this type of problem
Radiation treatment not implemented yet for AMR
Limited work in that direction by SzulÃ¡gyi et al. (2017)


## Any interesting observation to model?

Note:

Theory needs to be guided by observations

Need dynamical models -> talk to me

---

### Summary

- Dynamical models of planet-disk interaction
- Focus on small-scale structures
- Aim: treat radiation as accurately as possible
- Relevant to understand physical processes in circumplanetary disks
