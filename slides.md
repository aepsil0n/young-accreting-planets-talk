This is an outlook, I do not have any results

Note:

Current and next-gen observatories will give us more data

- SPHERE/VLT
- METIS/E-ELT
- MIRI/JWST
- ALMA

Visible, IR, Millimeter

Direct detection of accreting planets?

Note:

disk thickens around planet, high pressure scale height
donut-shaped structure

---

### Synthetic observations

Source: Ruge, Wolf, Uribe, Klahr (2014)

Note:

Should show features like

- Ring structures
- Spiral waves
- Horseshoe orbits
- Circumplanetary disk
- Accretion onto the planet

Feasibility of detecting gaps (caused by planets) with ALMA

### Interpreting observations

- *Dynamical model of planet-disk system*
- Detailed model of observed radiation (S. Wolf, Uni Kiel)

---

### Dynamical models of planet-disk system

- Internal energy of disk is dominated by radiation
- 3D radiation hydrodynamical numerical models

Note:

Treat radiation as accurately as possible in a dynamical setup

---

### Hydrodynamics

PLUTO for hydrodynamics (Mignone et al. 2007)

Note:

experience in group
availability of accurate radiation models

---

### Radiation treatment

- Approximate radiation model used within fluid simulations
- Internal disk radiation: flux-limited diffusion
- Stellar irradiation: frequency-dependent ray-tracing
- Based on:
  - *Kuiper, Klahr, Dullemond, Kley, Henning (2010)*
  - Flock, Fromang, González, Commerçon (2013)

Note:

FLD: strong simplification of radiative transfer

fast, thus practical for dynamical simulations
but leads to inaccuracies for transition from optically thin to optically thick
parts of the disk

fix at least dominant stellar irradiation using frequency-dependent ray-tracing

---

### Further aspects to study

- Dust opacities (so far Ossenkopf & Henning, 1994)
- Gas opacities (Malygin 2015/16)
- Accretion shock at planet (Marleau, Klahr, Kuiper, Mordasini; 2017)
- Adaptive mesh refinement
- Ionization for hot regions

Note:

AMR is very useful for this type of problem
Radiation treatment not implemented yet for AMR
Limited work in that direction by Szulágyi et al. (2017)

---

### Summary

- Dynamical models of planet-disk interaction
- Aim: treat radiation as accurately as possible
- Relevant to understand physical processes in circumplanetary disks

---

## Any interesting observation to model?

Note:

Theory needs to be guided by observations

Need dynamical models -> talk to me
