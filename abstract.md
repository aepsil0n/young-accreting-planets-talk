Characterization of young accreting planets

With a new generation of instruments we expect to observe accretion onto young
planets within disks. Such observations may allow us to put stronger constraints
on the processes governing this phase of planet formation. To derive properties
of planets and accretion processes from such observations, we need detailed
models of the circumplanetary disk structure. We are creating radiation
hydrodynamical models of improving detail of the planet-disk interaction to
enable comparisons to future observations.
